**Trigger:**

 A Trigger allows you to pause a sequence of actions on a certain frame and not resume the sequence until a specific action state is reached (Landing for Crouch Cancel, Guard for shield stun). 

With Samus or Peach a sequence might be: 

1. Frame 1-15 Squat
2. take a hit and land Frame 20
3. Frame 21=Trigger: ON->advance frame
4. Frame 23 d-smash.
