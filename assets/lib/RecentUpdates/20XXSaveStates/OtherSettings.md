**Some other useful settings:** 

- *Debug->Training Codes->In-Game Code Toggles->Save States/Replays-> Auto Record* at Match start will essentially allow you to record entire matches, although not save them. 
- Save States can sync match timer to a loaded Major/Minor Save State, if that is important to you for some reason. 
- You can also Begin a match with a Major Save to assist with the replaying in conjunction with Auto Record.
- There exists a setting called Random Hold Last percent chance, which will let you tone down or tone up the delay between actions.
