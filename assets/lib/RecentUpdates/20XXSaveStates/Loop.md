**Loop**: 

While recording, setting Loop: ON and advancing one frame will create a loop between the very first frame and the current frame, which allows a Player to infinitely repeat any given sequence. 

A sequence might be: 

1. Save Major Save State
2.  begin replay
3.  frame 1 enter jumpsquat with Falco
4.  frame 6 press B
5.  frame 19 Fast Fall
6.  Frame 28 Loop: ON -> advance Frame
7.  then Play Back.
