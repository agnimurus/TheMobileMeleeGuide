**Random Hold Last**: 

This will create a random frame delay between action. 

While recording, setting Random Hold Last: ON and advancing one frame will hold the input on the previous frame and randomly choose to copy that input for a variable number of frames. This will subtly change the timings of a looped action, such as Falco lasering, allowing you to create variation in looped inputs. 

This functionality has the problem of holding "too long" especially for falco's lasers so only use 1 Random Hold Last if you have a tight sequence of inputs you'd like to preserve. 

It will also delay all subsequent inputs, so some lasers will still fire since you won't fastfall for 11-13 frames after a laser.
